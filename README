This is a modification of jstephanop's original set_voltage utility for L3+ hashboards.  This is functionally the same utility as before and as such, if you use it, you should be donating to his addresses below.

-- From the original README
This tool allows voltage editing on Bitmain’s L3+ hashboards, it is provided free by the developer so if you find this useful and/or want me to update/provide new tools please donate to the below address. Thanks!

Usage:

scp binary to /config directory in your unit’s controller…this is the only directly that gets saved on reboot on antminers

Use: set_voltage -c chain [-v voltage] [-qp]
If you only list the chain, it will read the current voltage
If you include the optional voltage, it will set the chain's voltage
Flags: -q only outputs the voltage the pic is set to
       -p includes the pic version
Read example:
./set_voltage -c 1
Write example:
./set_voltage -c 1 -v b0

bitmains voltage controller can be configured to change the 12v input roughly +/- 1v from 10v, and this is configurable via a hex range of 0x00-0xfe, with the default being set to the middle (0x80). Higher hex values (0x80-0xfe) will LOWER voltage, lower values (0x00-0x7f) will INCREASE voltage from the default. 

For example if you want to slightly decrease your voltage on chain #1 you would input:

./set_voltage -c 1 -v 90

increments of 0x10 are good starting point to test a sweet spot for each board for a particular frequency. Lowering voltage until you get around 1 HW error per minute is usually a good reference “sweet spot”
